- Ready to start Data Engineering roadmap.
# Day 03 — COUNT & SUM

## Queries Practiced
- COUNT(*)
- SUM(salary)
- Aggregation with WHERE

## Key Learning
- Aggregations return single values
- Used for business-level questions
# Day 04 — GROUP BY

## Concepts
- GROUP BY splits data into categories
- Aggregations run per group

## Queries Practiced
- COUNT(*) GROUP BY department
- SUM(salary) GROUP BY department
# Day 05 — WHERE vs HAVING

## Key Difference
- WHERE filters rows before aggregation
- HAVING filters groups after aggregation

## Queries Practiced
- WHERE with SELECT
- GROUP BY with HAVING
# Day 06 — ORDER BY & LIMIT

## Concepts
- ORDER BY sorts result sets
- LIMIT restricts number of rows

## Queries Practiced
- Top-N salary queries
- ORDER BY ASC / DESC
# Day 07 — DISTINCT

## Concepts
- DISTINCT removes duplicate rows
- Works on selected columns

## Queries Practiced
- DISTINCT department
- DISTINCT on multiple columns
# Day 08 — NULL & COALESCE

## Concepts
- NULL represents missing values
- IS NULL is used for NULL checks
- COALESCE provides default values

## Queries Practiced
- Filtering NULLs
- Handling NULLs safely
# Day 09 — CASE WHEN

## Concepts
- Conditional logic in SQL
- Creating derived columns

## Queries Practiced
- Salary categorization
- CASE with aggregation
# Day 10 — INNER JOIN

## Tables Used
- employees
- departments

## Concepts
- INNER JOIN returns matching rows only
- Tables are linked via common columns

## Queries Practiced
- Employee + department join
# Day 12 — RIGHT JOIN & FULL JOIN

## Concepts
- RIGHT JOIN keeps all rows from right table
- FULL JOIN keeps all rows from both tables

## Use Cases
- Data completeness checks
- Audit queries
# Day 13 — Subqueries

## Concepts
- Subquery = query inside a query
- Inner query executes first

## Queries Practiced
- Subquery with WHERE
- Subquery with IN
# Day 14 — CTEs + SQL Revision Test

## New Concept
- CTE (WITH clause) for readable SQL

## Revision Covered
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
- ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT
- NULLs, CASE
- INNER & LEFT JOIN
- Subqueries
